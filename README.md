Botonomous is unique because of:
* Quality Code: Modern, high quality and fully unit tested code base
* Modular System: Pluggable architecture for enhanced management of commands
* OAuth 2.0 Support: Built-in [Add to Slack](https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button) button using OAuth 2.0
* Utility Classes: A handful of standalone utility classes to make everyone's life (even your partner's!) easier
